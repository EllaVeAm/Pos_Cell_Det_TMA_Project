# Pos_Cell_Det_TMA_Project
Contains ready made groovy scripts to detect positive cells in DAB stained Tissue microarrays. One script detects positive cells with strong cytoplasmic cytokeratin (DAB) staining in ductular structures and distinguishes them from the hematoxylin positive (faint blue) cells which are not arranged in ductular structures.
